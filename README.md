# DCF255 - Data Communications And Fundamentals

```
This repository contains all the work which I undertook and completed, while pursuing the
Data Communications and Fundamentals Course (Networking Aspects of Computer Science)
including the following:

* Lecture Notes ( Professor Provided Work )
* Labs ( Completed Solely by me )
* Assignments ( Group Collaboration )

NOTE: Assignments in this course were all a group comprehensive work so all the team members
      were involved to complete their share of work and contribute themselves
      to complete the whole assignment. Other than the assignments all the labs & remaining
      course work were completed by me solely.

-----------------------------------
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
-----------------------------------

* This course covers the fundamentals of data communications for computer programmers.
* Using well-known and widely-used Internet applications and standard networking technology as examples,
  it helps to prepare and learn topics that explain how distributed applications work on a network.
* In addition to this, the course's topics and assessments prepare to design and create software
  that works effectively in the modern connected world.
* This course is designed to support same-level programming courses, and for future programming courses
  which depend upon data communications and networking.

-----------------------------------
COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES:
-----------------------------------
With the successful completion of this subject:

One Can...

* Understand the terminology of data communications and networks to improve comprehension and the
  ability to explain to others.
* Identify network characteristics, and their hardware and software, to enable implementation and
  configuration tasks.
* Use published standards to compose a solution or work plan.
* Explain the structure and functionality of the internet and the TCP/IP protocol to improve your
  computer use and programming skills.
* Demonstrate knowledge and use of widely-used applications on the internet to complete common tasks.
* Create simple programs that communicate over a network.
* Examine a security, deployment, and reliability problems to understand an existing system, or
  to implement a new system.

I declare that all the code & programs in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of Data Communications & Fundamentals Concepts and it's topic
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
