# DCF255 - Data Communications And Fundamentals

```
This repository contains all the work which I undertook and completed, while pursuing the
Data Communications and Fundamentals Course (Networking Aspects of Computer Science)
including the following:

* Lecture Notes ( Professor Provided Work )
* Labs ( Completed Solely by me )
* Assignments ( Group Collaboration )

NOTE: Assignments in this course were all a group comprehensive work so all the team members
      were involved to complete their share of work and contribute themselves
      to complete the whole assignment. Other than the assignments all the labs & remaining
      course work were completed by me solely.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
# -----------------------------------
```
* This course covers the fundamentals of data communications for computer programmers.
* Using well-known and widely-used Internet applications and standard networking technology as examples,
  it helps to prepare and learn topics that explain how distributed applications work on a network.
* In addition to this, the course's topics and assessments prepare to design and create software
  that works effectively in the modern connected world.
* This course is designed to support same-level programming courses, and for future programming courses
  which depend upon data communications and networking.
