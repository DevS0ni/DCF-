# DCF255 - Data Communications And Fundamentals

```
This repository contains all the work which I undertook and completed, while pursuing the
Data Communications and Fundamentals Course (Networking Aspects of Computer Science)
including the following:

* Lecture Notes
* Labs
* Assignments

NOTE: Assignments in this course were all a group comprehensive work so all the team members
      were involved to complete their share of work and contribute themselves
      to complete the whole assignment. Other than the assignments all the labs & remaining
      course work were completed by me solely.
